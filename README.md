🚧 Work in Progress — Early Prototype

This project aims to build a production-oriented web application for converting handwritten notes from JPG / PNG / JPEG images into structured, persistent digital documents. Motivated by handwriting-centric workflows in study and professional settings, the system is designed to preserve handwritten content and structure in durable that can be reliably stored and managed on local or cloud systems.

After evaluating multiple OCR solutions, rednote/dots.ocr was selected for its strong performance in recognizing diverse handwriting styles. The project is currently in an early prototype stage, with ongoing development focused on model adaptation, system architecture, and cloud deployment.

Planned Development Roadmap:

OCR inference demo for handwritten image recognition

LoRA fine-tuning pipeline to improve handwriting accuracy

MLOps & deployment pipeline for scalable, reproducible inference
